Note to viewers and potential users:

There are a number of supplement codes for cosmology calculation that are called into some of the codes. Some of those supplement routines such as cosmological distance and volume calculations (now can be found on astropy) are not entirely created by me and so I am not authorized to share them publically here. Please contact me if you needed help running these routines as they are.  


updates:
Aug 20th --> all plots and measurements are in comoving coordinates

MCMC best fit with bth only 1 KDE one average of the four KDE bins and one averag of all the four bins

Sep 5th --> new estimatiion of the Mh and fsat is now deviating from the lower limit of fsat ~0.01 

Sep 20th --> kpc/Mpc section of the draft is updated

Sep 25th --> missing refereces in dat section are added 

Sepn28th --> added 10xc best fit result

Oct 10th --> second batch of comments received and applied 
Oct 20th  --> Fitting approach divisions

A fit to all of the data (All 4 KDE bins, all 8 KO12 bins; unless to discard overlapping KO12/KDE bins; and eBOSS)
A fit to eBOSS+(all 8) KO12 bins
A fit to eBOSS+(all 4) KDE bins

look at which pairs in the KDE parent sample we may miss at relevant comoving separations because we do not have spectroscopy of those pairs, estimate what fraction of them would be "binary" quasars based on our statistics for other target pairs, and expand the error bars on the KDE points to incorporate this possible source of incompleteness in each bin

Nov 1st all in one- check and compare the luminosity range of KO12 and KDE-> large scale bins are shared between the two sets of fitting results anyway
